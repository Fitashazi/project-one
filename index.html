        <h2>Exploring the Mysteries of the Universe</h2>
        <ul>
  <li>The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old.</li>
  <li>There are billions of galaxies in the observable universe, each containing billions to trillions of stars.</li>
  <li>The largest known structure in the universe is the cosmic web, a vast network of galaxy clusters connected by filaments of dark matter and gas.</li>
  <li>Neutron stars are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. A teaspoonful of neutron star material would weigh billions of tons on Earth.</li>
  <li>Black holes are regions in space with extremely strong gravitational forces, from which nothing, not even light, can escape.</li>
  <li>The universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other. This discovery led to the formulation of the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the universe began from a highly dense and hot state.</li>
  <li>The majority of the universe is made up of mysterious dark matter and dark energy, which cannot be directly observed but have significant gravitational effects on visible matter.</li>
  <li>Quasars are the most luminous objects in the universe, powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.</li>
  <li>Stars are responsible for creating heavier elements through nuclear fusion, which are then dispersed into space when stars explode as supernovae.</li>
  <li>Our solar system is located within the Milky Way galaxy, a spiral galaxy that is home to hundreds of billions of stars.</li>
</ul>
